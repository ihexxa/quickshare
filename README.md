## Quick Start

### Run in Docker (Recommended)

Following will start a `quickshare` docker and listen to `8686` port.

Then you can open `http://127.0.0.1:8686` and log in with user name `qs` and password `1234`:

```
docker run \
--name quickshare \
-d -p 8686:8686 \
-v `pwd`/quickshare/root:/quickshare/root \
-e DEFAULTADMIN=qs \
-e DEFAULTADMINPWD=1234 \
hexxa/quickshare
```

- `DEFAULTADMIN` is the default user name
- `DEFAULTADMINPWD` is the default user password
- `/quickshare/root` is where the Quickshare stores files and directories.
- Please refer to [this doc](./docs/doc.md) if you want to manage files and folders from OS.

### Run from source code

Before start, please confirm that Go/Golang (>=1.17), Node.js and Yarn are installed on your machine.

```
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:ihexxa/quickshare.git

# go to repo's folder
cd quickshare

DEFAULTADMIN=qs DEFAULTADMINPWD=1234 yarn start
```

OK! Open `http://127.0.0.1:8686` in browser, and log in with user name `qs` and password `1234`.
